# Soapbox Tech Assessment

- Never did anything with video streaming or editing before
- I have done in-browser photo editing
- Early steps will involve research on doing in-browser video editing.
- Focus on the overall architecture first, then shift to the browser API

The "edit points" are stored in a file format on the backend. A backend function will take the
edit points and the original video, then create a new video with the edits applied.

## Architecture and Main Flow

- User's raw video is stored on their computer's storage (this might be a mobile device).
- User uploads the raw video into a web form provided by the app's web UI.
- The raw video is uploaded to the backend.
- After upload, the backend makes a URL available where the video can be streamed from.
- The web UI displays the video from the URL, starting in a paused state.
- The user provides "edit points" which is just data that gets saved to the backend.
- When editing is complete, the user requests for a new video to be rendered.
- The backend applies video transforms based on the original video file and the edit points.
  The result is a new video file. This is made available to the user.

Question: Is there a difference between "streaming" and regular "downloading"? Research into this can
be done later. We will assume for now that the resource returned from a video URL is a whole video file.

This is the architecture that will be attempted at first. If my assumptions prove to
be incorrect, adjustments to the architecture can be made.

## Browser API

The first objective is to implement a minimal video player.

Web browsers provide a `<video>` tag. There is also an `<embed>` tag, but that tag
is deprecated.

- [x] Initial HTML document
- [x] Play sample video 1
- [ ] Custom video controls

### Try out web-based video player:

```
open index.html
```
